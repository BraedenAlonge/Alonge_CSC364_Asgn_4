-- How To Execute --

1. Create different terminals on your local machine.
2. There are four directories containing different files of variable length. This allows for the creation
    of four unique peers. To add more peers, add more Transfer-File directories, or assign multiple peers to a
    directory.
3. Before running the program, ensure that there are no "received_tfX.txt files. If there are, execute the following
    command using the program I created: "python ./remove-received-files.py"
4. First start the tracker server:
% python ./tracker.py

Note that the tracker server is running on port 9000.

5. Now, on each separate terminal, execute the peers. Here is an example run for four peers:
Terminal 1:
% python .\peer.py 1111 8001 .\Transfer-Files-Peer-1\ localhost 9000
Terminal 2:
% python .\peer.py 1121 8002 .\Transfer-Files-Peer-2\ localhost 9000
Terminal 3:
% python .\peer.py 1131 8003 .\Transfer-Files-Peer-3\ localhost 9000
Terminal 4:
% python .\peer.py 1141 8004 .\Transfer-Files-Peer-4\ localhost 9000

6. Once all files are transferred, safely exit by Keyboard Interrupt (Control+C on Windows)
7. The list of received files will display for each peer.
